//! # Bifrost transaction requirements
//!
//! Bifrost requires all off-chain transactions always have v2 and use
//! v1 witness P2TR outputs (or later witness versions). Transaction inputs,
//! aside from funding transaction, also must be v1 witness inputs spending
//! P2TR outputs (or above).
//!
//! For funding onchain transactions and funding outputs of channel level 1
//! this requirement is released to witness v0 or above. The reason for lower
//! requirement is the interoperability with the bolt lightning network,
//! allowing migration of existing channels opened in bolt network to
//! Bifrost.
//!
//!
//! # Channel coordination
//!
//! For channel operations we assume that any channel may be a multi-peer
//! channel. Thus, for channel updates it is required that all parties
//! cooperate and sign the latest version of updated channel transactions.
//! This is achieved by introducing concept of *channel coordinator*. Channel
//! coordinator is the lightning node that has originally proposed channel.
//! It is responsible for orchestrating message flow between all nodes which
//! are the parts of the channel and keeping them up-to-date. Also, the
//! channel coordinator is the only party required to have direct connections
//! with other channel participants – and each of channel participants is
//! required to be connected at least to the channel coordinator.
//!
//! If a multiple nested channels are present, for all higher-level channels
//! channel coordinator MUST be the same as channel coordinator for the base
//! (level 1) channel; the list of participants for the nested channels MUST be
//! a subset of the participants of the topmost level 1 channel.
//!
//!
//! # Channel workflows
//!
//! There are following workflows affecting channel status / existence. Each
//! of these workflows represent a set of P2P messages exchanged by channel
//! peers.
//!
//! - Channel creation
//! - Moving channel from bolt to Bifrost LN
//! - Removing channel from Bifrost to bolt LN
//! - Changing channel status (pausing etc)
//! - Upgrading channel to support more protocols
//! - Downgrading channel by removing specific protocol
//! - Cooperatively closing channel
//!
//! Workflow can be initiated only by a *channel coordinator*, and specific
//! P2P messages inside the workflow can be sent either from the *channel
//! coordinator* to a peer – or, in response, from a peer to the *channel
//! coordinator*.
//!
//! Normal channel operations are covered by application-specific business logic
//! and messages and are not part of any listed channel workflow. Unlike
//! workflows, they may be initiated by any of the channel peers sending message
//! to the channel coordinator, however whenever they involve other peers or
//! external channels, after being initiated they must be coordinated by the
//! channel coordinator.
//!
//! ## Channel creation workflow
//!
//! Considering generic case of multi-peer channel setup channel creation
//! workflow is organized with the following algorithm:
//!
//! 1. First, all parties agree on the structure of the *funding transaction*
//!    and overall transaction graph within the channel – simultaneously signing
//!    *refund transaction* (which, upon channel creation, will become first
//!    version of the channel *commitment transaction*). This is done using
//!    [`ProposeChannel`] requests sent by the *channel coordinator* to each of
//!    the peers, replying with either [`AcceptChannel`] (containing updated
//!    transaction graph with signed refund transaction) or [`Error`].
//!    peers must wait for `CHANNEL_CREATION_TIMEOUT` period and discard all
//!    provisional channel data from their memory.
//!
//! 2. Once the refund transaction is fully signed – implying that the
//!    transaction graph if agreed between participants – channel coordinator
//!    starts next phase, where the funding transaction gets fully signed.
//!    Coordinator sends [`FinalizeChannel`] message to each of the peers and
//!    collects signatures, publishing the final transaction either to bitcoin
//!    blockchain (for level 1 channels) or updating the state of the top-level
//!    channel (for nested channels above level 1). Peers track upper level
//!    channel or blockchain to detect funding transaction, and upon transaction
//!    mining starts operate channel in active mode, not requiring any other
//!    messages from the channel coordinator (NB: this differs from the bolt
//!    LN channel creation workflow).
//!  
//! 3. Replacing funding by fee (RBF): channel coordinator SHOULD initiate RBF
//!    subworkflow for level 1 channels if the funding transaction was not mined
//!    after reasonable amount of time, which should be less than
//!    [`ChannelParams::funding_timeout`]. With RGB subworkflow coordinator
//!    updates funding transaction – and propagates it with [`FinalizeChannel`]
//!    request, collecting new signatures (peers MUST reset their funding
//!    timeout counters).
//!
//! 4. Cancelling channel creation: if any of the peer nodes replied with
//!    [`Error`] on any of the channel construction requests within the channel
//!    creation workflow – or if the coordinator detected incorrect reply,
//!    channel coordinator MUST abandon channel creation – and MUST forward
//!    [`Error`] message to all other peers. A peer posting [`Error`] MUST
//!    provide a valid error code and a message explaining the cause of the
//!    error. The coordinator SHOULD also send [`Error`] message to peers if
//!    any of the stages of transaction construction workflow has stuck
//!    without a reply from a peer for over [`ChannelParams::peer_timeout`]
//!    time.
//!
//! 5. Timeouts: the coordinator SHOULD send [`Error`] message to peers if any
//!    of the peers at any stage of transaction construction workflow has stuck
//!    without a reply for over [`ChannelParams::peer_timeout`] time.
//!    The peers should abandon channel and clear all information about it from
//!    the memory regardless whether they have received [`Error`] message from
//!    the coordinator after [`ChannelParams::peer_timeout`]` * 2` time before
//!    `ChannelFinalized` – and if they has not received new
//!    [`FinalizeChannel`] request from the coordinator after
//!    [`ChannelParams::funding_timeout`] time (see pt 3 for RBF subworkflow).
